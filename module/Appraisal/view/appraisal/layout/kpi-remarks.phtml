                    First identify the key objectives of your job for the year and record
                    them in rough order of priority.
                    These are areas for which you have direct personal responsibility for
                    achieving results.
                    These objectives (Key Performance Indicator) should be
                    SMARTER-specific,measurable,agreed,
                    realistic,time-bound,ethical,and recorded.
                    Ideally they should not exceed half a dozen or so but may be supported
                    by more specific projects you undertake.
                    At the annual review Appraisee should summarize briefly his/her
                    achievements against the objectives with a self-rating.
                    The Appraiser should review the achievement and give a rating using the
                    scale below.
